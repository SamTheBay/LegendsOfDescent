<h1>Dungeon Game</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So far the goal is to make a pretty strait forward fantasy RPG for
the WP7 platform. One key piece is that we want to make the content of
the game as programmatically dynamic as possible. This can manifest
itself in being able to generate new dungeons, monsters, items and
quests on the fly. The action in the game should be fast similar to
that of Diablo of original Zelda. The graphics will be a 2d tile engine
for the environment and 2d sprites for everything else (though we may
want to put in some particle generators).</p>

<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In process</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<h3>Menus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Opening -</li>
<li>How to play -</li>
<li>Save/load game -</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay Controls</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Movement - If the player touches a point on the screen that does not have an enemy on it then they will move to that point</li>
    <li>Attacking
- If a player touches an enemy on the screen while they have a ranged
weapon (or spell) equipped then they will fire in the direction of that
enemy. If they do not have a ranged weapon they will move towards that
enemy. If they are already next to the enemy and they have a melee
weapon then they will attack.</li>
    <li>Hold - There will be a
button in the bottom left corner called the hold button. If the player
is touching this button then it will prevent them from moving. Anywhere
that they touch on the screen will result in them attacking in that
direction instead of moving</li>
    <li>Abilities - There will be
about 6 - 10 slots somewhere on the screen where the user can attach
fast actions. These can be spells, abilities, weapons, or consumable
items. If the user taps a weapon or a ranged spell/ability then they
will switch to that as their active attack. The next time they touch an
enemy on the screen this is the attack that they will use. If they
touch a consumable item they will use immediately. If they touch an
"Instance use" spell or ability then it will be used at that moment. An
example of this could be a super nova the hits everyone right around
the player (thus the user doesn't need to select an enemy to use it on).</li>
    <li>Life/Mana
- On the side of the screen (left side?) there will be a vertical bar
for life and verticle bar for health. If you double tap either of them
it will automatically use the most appropriate potion for you.</li>
    <li>Inventory
- I am thinking there could be a stub on the side of the screen for the
inventory. If you touch down on the stub and pan across the screen then
it will pull open your inventory so that you can use it. You can close
it in a similar fashion.</li>
    <li>Pause - The hardware back button will cause the game to pause.</li>
    <li>Minimap - Upper left corner? Transparent over the whole screen? Switch on and off via pause?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dungeons</h2>

<h3>Dungeon Generation</h3>
<p>Dungeons should be generated on the fly when the player reaches
them. It would be good to have a couple different algorithms that will
make dungeons with different feels. We can also get some different
feels by having a few different tile sets that we can use.</p>

<h2>NPC's</h2>
<h3>Friendly</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Vendors</li>
    <li>Quest Givers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enemies</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Goblin - basic melee enemy</li>
    <li>Goblin Mage - shoots fireballs from a range</li>
	<li>Skeleton - melee, has high magic resistance</li>
	<li>Skeleton Archer - ranged, has high magic resistance</li>
	<li>Ghost - goes invisible occasionally, must damage it to make it visible for a time</li>
	<li>Zombie - must be killed with fire damage or else it will come back to live with parital health</li>
	<li>FireElemental - immune to fire damage, vulnerable to cold</li>
	<li>Golumn - When killed it splits into smaller easier enemies</li>
	<li>Dragon - End boss?</li>

</ul>

<h2>Item Generation</h2>

<p>Items are defined in an xml file. However, we could generate variations on them by adding properties to them dynamically.</p>

<h2>Quest Generation</h2>

<p>Needs to be designed</p>

<h2>Enemy Generation</h2>

<p>None planned atm. Is out of scope.</p>
