  <Quest Name="Retrieve the Amulet of Legends"
   AskText="Your story is amazing, you truly are growing strong. I did not believe that you would be able to slow Dragnor down this much. I have completed my study of the scrolls and I am afraid the news is bad. Dragnor has found an ancient artifact known as the Soul Stone. It grants great powers to its owner, but it also causes irreversible corruption deep in the soul. Dragnor will continue to get more powerful as the corruption spreads throughout him. I am afraid it is too late for you to stop him alone. However, the scrolls speak of another ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Legends. The Amulet of Legends can protect you from the corruption of the Soul Stone. You must try to find it, it is hidden in the depths of the crystal caves. This is our only hope."
